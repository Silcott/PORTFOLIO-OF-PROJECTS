  * **Repository:**  https://github.com/Silcott/ISTA_Project/tree/master/myProject/Project_Track!T
  * **Description:**  This program will consist of a multi-role, ticket creation log in page, dashboard for users, dashboard for administrators, report page for a database that will hold ticket information such as auto-generated ticket ID, requester names, assigned groups, dates, phone numbers and email address. This will allow ticket searches and updates or deletes. There be profiles created through the log in screen that will be added to the database as well. Roles can be assigned by the administrators and levels of security will be established by those levels given. The database creation will be done with Microsoft SQL server and the coding will be written with C# programming language. This overall will allow me to gain and use the knowledge needed to be a Software Engineer.

  * **Repository:**  https://github.com/Silcott/PORTFOLIO-OF-PROJECTS/tree/master/PROJECTS/AnimalFarm_CSharp
  * **Description:**  This is a program I designed in C# to show methods and class creations. I created 3 pigs, 3 horses, 3 cows, and 3 chickens. Each has their own function of speak, eat, produce, and move. I got a little carried away with this project and wanted to maximize the screen and center the WriteLineâ€™s, add some sounds, bring a little color and some ACSII text into the mix. I had a lot of fun building this, please enjoy!
  * **Tools:**  C#
  * **NO. Lines of code:**  639

  * ### Console App - Military Units

  * **Repository:**  https://github.com/Silcott/PORTFOLIO-OF-PROJECTS/tree/master/PROJECTS/MilitaryUnit
  * **Description:**  Another C# program built with fun! Using inheritance, abstraction, classes and objects, I implemented a military unit of tanks.  I created several classes of World War 1 and 2 tanks.  Added the flare of ASCII Text charcters I learned from the animal farm, inputted a little WIN32 defualt sounds, created a fullscreen funtion, and created my first easter egg in a program.  It wasn;t that hard to find, but I fiqwured it qould be a cool addition.  Overall, lots of fun and learned a lot.  I used dictionary and lists for the first time which turns out to make the ASCII art a lot easier to do animation. Enjoy!
  * **Tools:**  C#
  * **NO. Lines of code:**  1,814

  * **Repository:**  https://github.com/Silcott/PORTFOLIO-OF-PROJECTS/tree/master/PROJECTS/RouletteWheel
  * **Description:**  These projects have been the hardest to date.  Lots of time and effort went into fiquring out the correct way to randomize card shuffles and ball drops.  Not easy is an understatment for the first experience.  Overall create learning project.  Enjoy!

  * **Repository:**  https://github.com/Silcott/PORTFOLIO-OF-PROJECTS/tree/master/PROJECTS/WaterDashBoard
  * **Description:**  This is an overkill excel spreadheet with all the bells and whistles.  I used a lot of formulas and coded in VBA to make fullscreen modes and create a dashboard that felt like an app to capture all the data my team was getting from a deployment to Suadi Arbaia.  We were in charge of all teh water on base and this helped us win the Team of the Month award and many praises from leaders. Enjoy!
  * **Tools:**  Visual Basic in Excel
