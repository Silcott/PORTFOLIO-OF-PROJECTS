  * **Repository:**  https://github.com/Silcott/LegalLeadCloser
  * **Description:**  LegalLeadCloser is an app for attorneys. It offers quick and effective detailed walk-throughs with clients about their case and captures all the information for the attorney to best understand the clients needs and secure the business closure. It takes the guess work out, streamlines the buisness communication, and keeps all the information secure and mobile. Designed using Blazor Webassembly 5.0 built with MudBlazor Components. [Click Here](https://github.com/Silcott/LegalLeadCloser) to see more info on this.
  * **Tools:**  BLAZOR, C#, SQL, JavaScript, HTML, CSS

### Ticket Application - "Trackin!T"
  <!--* **View Project:**  http://www.insertpage.com-->
  
<img align="right" height="270px" width="450px" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Silcott/ISTA_Project/master/myProject/Project_Track!T/Pictures/gif/trackIT.gif" alt="html" style="vertical-align:top; margin:4px">  
  
  * **Repository:**  https://github.com/Silcott/ISTA_Project/tree/master/myProject/Project_Track!T
  * **Description:**  This program consists of a multi-role, ticket creation login page, dashboard for users, dashboard for administrators, report page for a database that holds ticket information such as auto-generated ticket ID, requester names, assigned groups, dates, phone numbers and email address. This allows ticket searches and updates or deletes. There are profiles created through the login screen that is added to the database as well. Roles are assigned by the administrators and levels of security are established by those levels given. There are two versions, one with a database creation using Microsoft SQL server and the other with Sqlite to be more compact and deployable.  The Sqlite version was all created line by line and automatically recreates itself if deleted.  [Click Here](https://github.com/Silcott/PORTFOLIO-OF-PROJECTS/blob/master/PROJECTS/Ticket%20App%20-%20Trackin!T/CodeBreakDown.txt) to view my text file that explains the code break down and challenges I faced.
  * **Tools:**  C#, SQL, JavaScript, HTML, CSS

### C# Console App - My Animal Farm
  <!--* **View Project:**  http://www.insertpage.com-->
  
<img align="right" height="270px" width="450px" alt="GIF" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Silcott/PORTFOLIO-OF-PROJECTS/master/PROJECTS/AnimalFarm_CSharp/AnimalFarmGif.gif" />
  
  * **Repository:**  https://github.com/Silcott/PORTFOLIO-OF-PROJECTS/tree/master/PROJECTS/AnimalFarm_CSharp
  * **Description:**  This is a program I designed in C# to show methods and class creations. I created 3 pigs, 3 horses, 3 cows, and 3 chickens. Each has their own function of speak, eat, produce, and move. I got a little carried away with this project and wanted to maximize the screen and center the WriteLineâ€™s, add some sounds, bring a little color and some ACSII text into the mix. I had a lot of fun building this, please enjoy!
  * **Tools:**  C#

### C# Console App - Military Units
  <!--* **View Project:**  http://www.insertpage.com-->
  
<img align="right" height="270px" width="450px" alt="GIF" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Silcott/PORTFOLIO-OF-PROJECTS/master/PROJECTS/MilitaryUnit/militaryUnits.gif" />
  
  * **Repository:**  https://github.com/Silcott/PORTFOLIO-OF-PROJECTS/tree/master/PROJECTS/MilitaryUnit
  * **Description:**  Another C# program built with fun! Using inheritance, abstraction, classes, and objects, I implemented a military unit of tanks.  I created several classes of World War 1 and 2 tanks.  Added the flare of ASCII Text characters I learned from the animal farm, inputted a little WIN32 default sounds, created a Fullscreen function, and created my first Easter egg in a program.  It was not that hard to find, but I figured it would be a cool addition.  Overall, lots of fun and learned a lot.  I used dictionary and lists for the first time which turns out to make the ASCII art a lot easier to do animation. Enjoy!
  * **Tools:**  C#

### C# Console App - Casino - Cards & Roulette
  <!--* **View Project:**  http://www.insertpage.com-->
  
<img align="right" height="270px" width="450px" alt="GIF" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Silcott/PORTFOLIO-OF-PROJECTS/master/PROJECTS/RouletteWheel/rouletteTable.svg" />
  
  * **Repository:**  https://github.com/Silcott/PORTFOLIO-OF-PROJECTS/tree/master/PROJECTS/RouletteWheel
  * **Description:**  These projects have been the hardest to date.  Lots of time and effort went into figuring out the correct way to randomize card shuffles and ball drops.  Not easy is an understatement for the first experience.  Overall this was a great learning project.  Enjoy!  
  * **Tools:**  C#
   
### C# Console App -  Number Guessing Game
  <!--* **View Project:**  http://www.insertpage.com-->
  
<img align="right" height="270px" width="450px" alt="GIF" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Silcott/PORTFOLIO-OF-PROJECTS/master/PROJECTS/NumberGuessingGame/gif/numberGuessGame.gif" />
  
  * **Repository:**  https://github.com/Silcott/PORTFOLIO-OF-PROJECTS/tree/master/PROJECTS/NumberGuessingGame/ProgEX08-Silcott/Program.cs
  * **Description:**  This demonstrates a bisection algorithm I wrote for finding a generated random number in a sorted list.  First, it checks the middle element in the list.  It has three possibilities: the value can equal the middle value, be higher than the middle value, or be lower than the middle value.  The algorithm (recursively) calls itself with the top half of the list when it is higher and if its lower it calls itself with the bottom of the list. Overall, I am seeing my code improve.  Not just in understanding but in the structure layout.  I am thinking all the time the best location to place a variables, methods, or classes and how to call them.  Of course, I added the flare, added some art to show a thumbs up or thumbs down for high/low values and this time I figured out how to create a list of methods, which randomized the indexes to change the colors of an Easter Egg, like twinkling lights.  Happy hunting for those looking!
  * **Tools:**  C#
  
### Visual Basic & Excel App - Water Dashboard
  <!--* **View Project:**  http://www.insertpage.com-->

  * **Repository:**  https://github.com/Silcott/PORTFOLIO-OF-PROJECTS/tree/master/PROJECTS/WaterDashBoard
  * **Description:**  This is an overkill excel spreadsheet with all the bells and whistles.  I used a lot of formulas and coded in VBA to make Fullscreen modes and create a dashboard that felt like an app to capture all the data my team was getting from a deployment to Saudi Arabia.  We oversaw all the water on base, and this helped us win the Team of the Month award and many praises from leaders. Enjoy!
  * **Tools:**  Visual Basic in Excel

### Website - My Portfolio
  <!--* **View Project:**  http://www.insertpage.com-->

  * **Repository:**  https://github.com/Silcott/silcott.github.io/blob/master/index.html
  * **Description:**  I created a portfolio website https://silcott.github.io/, which is free to use a one-page site on GitHub to share along my journey and get the experience in creating a  website.  I used HTML, CSS, and jQuery/JavaScript.  I included a form at the bottom that I used https://formspree.io/ to create a responsive form.   Overall, I already knew a lot about web development, but it is always fun to build something like this.  Enjoy!
  * **Tools:**  HTML, CSS, jQuery/JavaScript

  * **Repository:**  https://github.com/Silcott/PORTFOLIO-OF-PROJECTS/tree/master/PROJECTS/Turtle/birthday.py
  * **Description:**  This is something I did when I first started learning python.  It uses the Turtle tool that python has for young developers.  I programmed the turtle to move around and draw a message, which in this case is telling myself Happy Birthday.  Not a bad program.  It was hard to figure out how to turn the turtle and create the heart shapes were a real challenge.  Enjoy!
  * **Tools:**  Python

<img align="right" height="270px" width="450px" alt="GIF" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Silcott/PORTFOLIO-OF-PROJECTS/master/PROJECTS/HistoryTest/assets/gif/historyTest.gif">
  
  * **Repository:**  https://github.com/Silcott/PORTFOLIO-OF-PROJECTS/tree/master/PROJECTS/HistoryTest/Program.cs
  * **Description:** I designed a web scraper to pull a CSV file off a given URL address.  Afterwards, it strips any commas and spaces, then separates every fifth line to be the questions and creates a list for the rest as answers.  The first answer is correct, so I created a randomizer that gives you the questions and answers out of order.   I also designed my first debugger, which demonstrates behind the scenes functions.   
  * **Tools:**  C#

  * **Repository:**  https://github.com/Silcott/PORTFOLIO-OF-PROJECTS/tree/master/PROJECTS/MVC_CreatePerson/Program.cs
  * **Description:** This is my first attempt at building a (MVC) Model, View, Controller pattern.  I had a project to design a person class.  Of course, I took it a few steps more, even though it does not look like much I decided to build a form with links, store the database with SQL, then deploy it with Azure.  I became very familiar with string connections and how SQL and Azure relate.
  * **Tools:**  C#, SQL, Azure, Razor
