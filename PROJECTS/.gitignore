# The rules for the patterns you can put in the .gitignore file are as follows:
# 	Blank lines or lines starting with # are ignored.
# 	Standard glob patterns work, and will be applied recursively throughout the entire working tree.
# 	You can start patterns with a forward slash (/) to avoid recursivity.
# 	You can end patterns with a forward slash (/) to specify a directory.
# 	You can negate a pattern by starting it with an exclamation point (!).
# Glob patterns are like simplified regular expressions that shells use. 
# An asterisk (*) matches zero or more characters; 
# [abc] matches any character inside the brackets (in this case a, b, or c); 
# a question mark (?) matches a single character; 
# and brackets enclosing characters separated by a hyphen ([0-9]) 
# matches any character between them (in this case 0 through 9). 
# You can also use two asterisks to match nested directories; 
# a/**/z would match a/z, a/b/z, a/b/c/z, and so on
