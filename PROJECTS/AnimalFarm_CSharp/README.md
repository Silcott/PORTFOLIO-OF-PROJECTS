# Console Application - My Animal Farm

[Click HERE to see my Code!](https://github.com/Silcott/PORTFOLIO-OF-PROJECTS/blob/master/PROJECTS/AnimalFarm_CSharp/program04/Program.cs)

## Project Length: 2 hours

## Intro
Hello, my name is James Silcott.  I am currently attending MSSA.  This was a project for my C# class.  

## Overview of Project
Using classes and objects, I needed to implement a farm.  Create a class containing a Main() function that exercises other classes.  Create classes representing several types of domesticated animals, such as cows, sheep, chickens, goats, etc.  Instantiate several objects of each class.  For example, for my Pig class has instantiated objects named Miss Piggy, Porky, and Wilber.

## Grading Criteria
```
- 70 points: Implement one class of a farm animal. You can choose your type
of animal: horses, cows, pigs, sheep, etc. For our class, implement at least one field, such as a name field,
and at least two methods, such as a speak or an eat method. Also implement two constructors, a default
constructor that takes no parameters and another constructor that takes at least one parameter, such as (for
example) the object name.

- 80 points: For your class for the previous step, implement a unit test that invokes each
method. You should create a Test project and create unit test for your class. Test all methods.

- 90 points: Create four or more animals from your class. Invoke all methods for each. If
you create pigs, you can have Porky, Wilbur, Miss Piggy, and Napoleon (the pig leader in Orwell’s Animal
Farm). You can implement a speak() method for each animal. A pig can say, “Oink.” A cow can say,
“Moo.” A chicken can say, “Cluck.” You get the idea.

- 100 points: Implement one farm animal by creating a class and a method.
For example, you may elect to create a Horse type, and a speak() method. In your main program, instantiate
a Horse, name him Mr. Ed, and call the speak() method. When Mr. Ed speaks, he might say something like,
“Hello, my name is Mr. Ed, and I am a horse. I say neigh.”
```

## My Conclusion

I really enjoyed this project.  I first started with the class creation of the pig and created the methods. 
I realized I wanted to center my Console.Writeline text which literally started me down a path that I 
couldn't (didn't want to stop).  I found that I could maximize the screen to full screen and find the value
of the pixels across the width of the screen.  I took this value, divided by two and "wal-lah", it worked!  

<br>My text now had a center starting ground to work from.  Then I wanted to add some ASCII text, which if you
don't know that text that looks like a shape made out of keyboard characters.  I googled searched these and
found some that fit great for the animals I choose.  Next up was color and this was easy.  I already have 
experience working in CSS/HTML so I just applied the foreground and background colors wherever I saw fit.

<br>Finally I knew this project was now becoming dynamic, but it was missing a noise, so I searched the web
again and found a script that called the notification and hand bells from WIN32 default file.  I spent awhile
on this, just to later find out that the 30 lines of code I used really could be replaced by one line of code.
Well that’s how coding works in a way.  If you want something go research it and then try it out using it
towards your program.  Overall, this was a great little project that can really test your creativity if you let it.
