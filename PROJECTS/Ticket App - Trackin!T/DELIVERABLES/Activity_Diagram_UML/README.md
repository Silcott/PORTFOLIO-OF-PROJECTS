## (UML)Unified Modeling Language | Activity Diagram 
#### We use Activity Diagrams to illustrate the flow of control in a system and refer to the steps involved in the execution of a use case. We model sequential and concurrent activities using activity diagrams. So, we basically depict workflows visually using an activity diagram. An activity diagram focuses on condition of flow and the sequence in which it happens. We describe or depict what causes a particular event using an activity diagram.


NORMALIZATION AND INTEGRITY CONSTRAINTS
### TOPICS DISCUSSED
1. What is First normal form: 
##### First normal form (1NF) is a property of a relation in a relational database. A relation is in first normal form if and only if the domain of each attribute contains only atomic (indivisible) values, and the value of each attribute contains only a single value from that domain.
2. What is second normal form:
##### Second normal form (2NF) is a normal form used in database normalization. ... A relation is in the second normal form if it fulfills the following two requirements: It is in first normal form. It does not have any non-prime attribute that is functionally dependent on any proper subset of any candidate key of the relation.
3. What is third normal form:
##### Third normal form is a database schema design approach for relational databases which uses normalizing principles to reduce the duplication of data, avoid data anomalies, ensure referential integrity, and simplify data management.
4. What is entity integrity:
##### Entity Integrity is the mechanism the system provides to maintain primary keys. The primary key serves as a unique identifier for rows in the table. Entity Integrity ensures two properties for primary keys: The primary key for a row is unique; it does not match the primary key of any other row in the table.
5. What is domain integrity:
##### The allowed values of an attribute establish domain integrity, which ensures that all data in a field contains valid values. Domain integrity is defined by: The data type—such as integer, character, or decimal. The allowed length of the data.
6. What is referential integrity:
##### Referential integrity is a property of data stating that all its references are valid. ... In other words, when a foreign key value is used it must reference a valid, existing primary key in the parent table.
7. What is logical (business) integrity:
##### Business integrity, also called user integrity, ensures that the database enforces user-defined business rules, regulations, policies, and procedures. You usually enforce business integrity by using stored procedures and triggers.
