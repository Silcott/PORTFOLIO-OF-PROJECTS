# A User & Admin Database Ticket Recording Application – I’m calling it, "Track!T".

## Intro
Hello, my name is James Silcott.  I am currently attending MSSA.  I wanted to choose a project that showcased my knowledge that I learned from the classes, such as TSQL, C#, and web development.

## Overview of Project
This program will consist of a multi-role, ticket creation log in page, dashboard for users, dashboard for administrators, report page for a database that will hold ticket information such as auto-generated ticket ID, requester names, assigned groups, dates, phone numbers and email address.  This will allow ticket searches and updates or deletes.  There be profiles created through the log in screen that will be added to the database as well.  Roles can be assigned by the administrators and levels of security will be established by those levels given.  The database creation will be done with Microsoft SQL server and the coding will be written with C# programming language.  This overall will allow me to gain and use the knowledge needed to be a Software Engineer.  

## What’s First:
### Planning Phase
	- Researching and learning C# in building forms and user interfaces
	- Building a SQL database that can be used with C# sharp

### Design Phase
	- Establish timelines and project milestones
	- Create a design layout of classes and object that need to be created
	- Pseudo code and create a flow chart


### Build/Programming Phase
- Design Home Page
- Create Database in SQL
- Connecting Database
- Design Form for Users Module
- Create Business Logic Layer – BLL
- Create Methods to Users
- Adding ADD, UPDATE, DELETE for Users
- Upload Images
- Add Search Functionality for Users
- Design Form for Customer Module
- Create BLL for Customer Module
- Create Methods to Customers
- Create ADD, UPDATE, DELETE for Customers
- Upload Profile Picture for Customers
- Refresh Dashboard on Database Change
- Add Search Functionality for Customers
- Design Login Form
- Add Login Functionality
- Saving and Displaying Logged in Users
- Create Animated – Loading Progress – Splash Screen
- Bug Fixing 

### Bug Fix/Working Phase
	- Discover any bugs and fix

The project I have chosen 
is a type of ticket tracker application for development teams to take in any 
defects from their software.  They track those defects and issues through 
tickets.  As they close those ticket items, allowing them the ability to 
mark them open, closed, under development.  This gives a workflow that 
allows the development manager to see the process for the overall project. 
This application can be used for customer service help desk systems, 
delivery notification systems, or Field Force Automation for field workers 
such as repair companies. 
<br><br>The first stage of the project will be the programming phase.  This 
phase will consist of developing schedule using Software Requirements  
Specification (SRS) processes and dividing them up into weekly batches.  
Some of the process identified are to create the following; create a logging 
page, a user interface and dashboard that allows you to take create, update, 
delete tickets and have a search function to look up tickets and information.  
<br><br>Second, I will be creating these with Microsoft SQL Server Studio 
and Visual Studio C#.  I will be tracking the weekly processes.  At first I 
will track with an excel sheet and later as the application starts, I will 
track with the application I am creating.  
<br><br>Furthermore, I understand C# and can create all the necessary coding 
that will be required to build the application.  I will start with the user 
interface and layout making buttons, selection boxes and dropdown boxes for 
use and inputs of ticket information.
<br><br>Finally, I will start building this by first finishing up any 
research that is needed then begin with the user interface and how it should 
look for the layout and buttons.  Afterwards I will createt eh database to 
load all the information that the tickets will hold such as name, email 
address, phone numbers, description of the issue of help that is required, 
some details, dates, and possible attachments  such as pictures or documents 
that can be loaded from the end user.  I also intend on have this notify the 
development manager by email or separate screen of all the tickets that are 
sorted by progress and dates they were created.
<br><br>This project like I said earlier will be built by using C# in Visual 
Studio and SQL database.  I will create a log in and user interface for 
users to input tickets and information that that will help identify who they 
are and their issues that they need help with by creating dropdown boxes, 
selection boxes, and buttons, and lastly a place for the development manager 
to see the overall progress of the application and all the tickets that 
users create that can be easily sorted by dates and progress.
