#### 1. A first paragraph or two as the introduction introducing yourself and stating your personal objectives for your project.

Hi, I’m James Silcott and I am going to make a project that I can expand my knowledge working with C#, T-SQL, HTML5, CSS3, and/or JavaScript. After the project is successful, my plan is to upload it to my social media platforms such as GitHub and LinkedIn accounts.


#### 2. The body of your paper as follows:
(a) A paragraph or two describing your first reviewed project, and how that project will help you
accomplish your personal objectives.
-	My first project is an application that is built from C# and uses TSQL querying.  I want to build an app that stores information that is similar to a business card but also allows the user to input a picture.  The user can store this info and be able to easily find contacts.


(b) A paragraph or two describing your second reviewed project, and how that project will help you
accomplish your personal objectives.
-	Create a code snippet program using C#, Python, and SQL commonly used commands that I will store.  This will give me a place to easily access the code I need to use by having a filter and/or keyword search.


(c) A paragraph or two describing your third reviewed project, and how that project will help you
accomplish your personal objectives.
-	Design and create an app for food recipes and meal plan. Program the app to store recipes, ingredients, quantities, printable shopping list, pictures of the meal…etc.


(d) (optional) A paragraph or two describing your fourth reviewed project, and how that project will
help you accomplish your personal objectives.
-	Create a webpage portfolio that showcases all my projects.



#### 3. A  final paragraph or two as the conclusion reflecting on how you will achieve your personal objectives by building the project. Your paper should have a title, author, and date. The subdivisions of your paper should have appropriate section and subsection headings.

My conclusion is that I want to start programming and developing my skills by using the things I’ve been taught such as python, C#, SQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  I want to see the project become successful and for my journey to learn from any mistakes and push myself to work through problems and overcome issues as they arise.
