## <div align="center"> Help Desk Application

<p>Greetings, my name is James Silcott and I am working on a project for the 
Microsoft Cloud Application Development course.  The project I have chosen 
is a type of ticket tracker application for development teams to take in any 
defects from their software.  They track those defects and issues through 
tickets.  As they close those ticket items, allowing them the ability to 
mark them open, closed, under development.  This gives a workflow that 
allows the development manager to see the process for the overall project. 
This application can be used for customer service help desk systems, 
delivery notification systems, or Field Force Automation for field workers 
such as repair companies. 
<br><br>The first stage of the project will be the programming phase.  This 
phase will consist of developing schedule using Software Requirements  
Specification (SRS) processes and dividing them up into weekly batches.  
Some of the process identified are to create the following; create a logging 
page, a user interface and dashboard that allows you to take create, update, 
delete tickets and have a search function to look up tickets and information.  
<br><br>Second, I will be creating these with Microsoft SQL Server Studio 
and Visual Studio C#.  I will be tracking the weekly processes.  At first I 
will track with an excel sheet and later as the application starts, I will 
track with the application I am creating.  
<br><br>Furthermore, I understand C# and can create all the necessary coding 
that will be required to build the application.  I will start with the user 
interface and layout making buttons, selection boxes and dropdown boxes for 
use and inputs of ticket information.
<br><br>Finally, I will start building this by first finishing up any 
research that is needed then begin with the user interface and how it should 
look for the layout and buttons.  Afterwards I will createt eh database to 
load all the information that the tickets will hold such as name, email 
address, phone numbers, description of the issue of help that is required, 
some details, dates, and possible attachments  such as pictures or documents 
that can be loaded from the end user.  I also intend on have this notify the 
development manager by email or separate screen of all the tickets that are 
sorted by progress and dates they were created.
<br><br>This project like I said earlier will be built by using C# in Visual 
Studio and SQL database.  I will create a log in and user interface for 
users to input tickets and information that that will help identify who they 
are and their issues that they need help with by creating dropdown boxes, 
selection boxes, and buttons, and lastly a place for the development manager 
to see the overall progress of the application and all the tickets that 
users create that can be easily sorted by dates and progress.
